# Stack vs Heap

we dont have garbage collector like java

2 important memory area -  stack and heap

## Stack

allocation and deallocation is automatic

size should be available at compile time

fast

size of memory is less. in orders of mb and its fixed

## Heap

bigger size. like many GB

allocate and deallocate should be done by programmer

-new and delete

slow 

its in the RAM
