If you want to define a global variable that has a constant value, you can use either constexpr or static constexpr. The difference between them is related to their visibility (linkage) across different translation units (source files) in C++.

## constexpr: 
A constexpr global variable has external linkage by default. This means the variable can be accessed from other translation units (source files) in the program. If you declare a constexpr global variable in a header file, and that header file is included in multiple source files, you'll get multiple instances of that variable, which could lead to linker errors due to redefinition.

## static constexpr: 
A static constexpr global variable has internal linkage. This means that each translation unit (source file) that includes the declaration of the variable will get its own separate instance of the variable. This can help avoid potential linker errors due to redefinition when the variable is declared in a header file that's included in multiple source files.

So, if you want the constant to be visible across multiple source files, you should use constexpr. If you want to limit the visibility to the same source file and avoid potential redefinition issues, you should use static constexpr.

## Here is an example:

cpp
Copy code
// In a header file
static constexpr int globalVar = 10; // Each source file that includes this header will get its own separate instance of globalVar
Or

cpp
Copy code
// In a source file
constexpr int globalVar = 10; // The variable globalVar can be accessed from other source files
Remember, constexpr enforces that the value is a constant expression, evaluated at compile time, and the variable can't be modified later.
