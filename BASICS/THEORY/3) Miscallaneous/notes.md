release mode vs debug mode
you can compile in release or debug mode.


when you look at the assembler code in both modes, you can see that assembler code in relase mode has less code lines than that of debug mode. 


assembler code with more lines are always slower than assembler code with less code lines.


-Oo - debug mode ( not optimization)


-O1 to -O3 different levels of compiler optimizations.


summary: in relsease mode the code is very optimized.
